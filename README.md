# Welcome  

I focus on **Go development**, **automation**, and **homelab projects**. Most of my work is about streamlining processes, automating tasks, and experimenting with tools to make systems more reliable.

## What Iâ€™m Working On  
- Backend services and automation in **Go**  
- **Homelab projects** with containers, self-hosted apps, and reverse proxies  
- Building **TUI dashboards** and small creative coding projects

## Tech & Tools  
- **Languages**: Go, Odin, Ruby, Python  
- **Ops & Infra**: Podman, Caddy, Gitea  
- **Other tools**: Neovim, Ghostty, Raylib  

---

## Interests  
- Workflow automation  
- Containerization and self-hosting  
- Creative projects: text adventures, MUDs, simulations  
- Exploring where business, tech, and creativity overlap  

---

## Highlights  
- Always refining my **Neovim/Ghostty setup**  
- Built a **black hole photon-bending simulation**  
- Projects are part practical, part experimental
