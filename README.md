# Hi there,

I work where **business and technology** overlap: improving processes, automating tasks, and experimenting with tools that make systems run better.  

---

## What Iâ€™m Working On  
- Side projects in **Go** (backend services & automation)  
- **Homelab experiments** with containers, self-hosted apps, and reverse proxies  
- Building **TUI dashboards** and small coding projects  

---

## Tech & Tools  
- **Languages**: Go, Odin, Ruby, Python  
- **Ops & Infra**: Podman, Caddy, Gitea  
- **Other tools**: Neovim, Ghostty, Raylib (for simulations)  

---

## Interests  
- Workflow automation and process optimization  
- Containerization and self-hosted infrastructure  
- Creative projects (text adventures, MUDs, simulations)  
- Exploring where **business + tech + creativity** meet  

---

## Highlights  
- Always tweaking my **Neovim/Ghostty setup**  
- Built a **black hole photon-bending simulation**  
- Projects are half practical, half experimental

## Find Me  
- [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/linuxunil)  
- Open to collaboration through GitHub issues and discussions

*Always building, always experimenting.*
